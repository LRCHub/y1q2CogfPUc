Lion love is like the sun
Shining heart of everyone
Lion dreams of Venus' arms
Goddess hands, soft, magic charm

And you know that I look up to you, starry, starry night
Oh, I (oh, I), yes, I (yes, I)
I can feel your arms made of the sky hug everything alive
So kind (so kind), so right (so right)

Love, cosmic love
Shining on you (hoo-ooh-ooh)
Love, cosmic love
Shining on you (hoo-ooh-ooh)

We can see that Lightyear glow
Stardust Bees, a galactic rose
Big Bang dreams of painted blue
Lion love is shining through

And you know that I look up to you, starry, starry night
Oh, I (oh, I), yes, I (yes, I)
I can feel your arms made of the sky hug everything alive
So kind (so kind), so right (so right)

Love, cosmic love
Shining on you (hoo-ooh-ooh)
Love, cosmic love
Shining on you (hoo-ooh-ooh)

Let the love be

Love, cosmic love
Shining on you
Love, cosmic love
Shining on you

Love, cosmic love
Shining on you (shining on you)
Love, cosmic love (let the love be)
Shining on you (shining on you)
Love, cosmic love (cosmic love)
Shining on you (let the love be)
Love, cosmic love (shining on you)
Shining on you (cosmic love)
