If I had a dollar
For every dream of you and me
I'd buy myself a rocket
And shoot into your galaxy

There wouldn't be no parts unknown
I'd search every uncharted zone
And when it's time to come back home
I'll send ya my antenna
Is pointed at

My cosmic love
You're my cosmic love
From the stars above, you're mine
(Ooh) you're my cosmic love

Incoming transmission
I'm crashing through your atmosphere
There's no interference, no
I read you darling loud and clear
Because you're my

My cosmic love
You're my cosmic love
From the stars above, you're mine
(Ooh) you're my cosmic love
My cosmic love

My cosmic love from up above
You are the one I'm thinking of
My cosmic love (my cosmic love)
My cosmic love from up above
You are the one I'm thinking of
My cosmic love (my cosmic love)
My cosmic love

My cosmic love from up above
You are the one I'm thinking of (you're my)
My cosmic love (my cosmic love, you're my)
My cosmic love from up above (you're mine)
You are the one I'm thinking of (you're my)
My cosmic love (cosmic love)
